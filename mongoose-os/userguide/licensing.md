# Licensing

Mongoose OS is highly modular. It consists of the
[core](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-os)
and a large number of
[libraries](https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs). The core, and most of
the libraries, are open source and released under the
[Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) as Mongoose OS Community Edition.

Some of the libraries are closed-source, and have certain restrictions.
Those restrictions can be removed by purchasing a Mongoose OS Enterprise Edition license.

## Mongoose OS Enterprise Edition Licensing process

- Make sure that `rpc-service-ota` library is used by your app
- Login to the [Mongoose License Manager](https://license.mongoose-os.com)
- Buy any number of licenses you need. IMPORTANT: choose "mongoose-os" license type
- If your device is connected to your workstation over USB, run:
  ```
  mos license
  ```
- Or, if your device is accessible remotely, run:
  ```
  mos --port DEVICE_ADDRESS license
  ```

Licenses are bound to devices, and they are permanent.

The `mos license` command creates a unique license string specific
for a device,
and updates `device.license` configuration parameter, which "unlocks"
the device and removes restrictions. The License Manager decreases
the number of available licenses and saves a unique
license string. The next time `mos license` is run for the same device,
an old license string is returned by the License Manager
but the number of available licenses is not decreased.
Thus a device, once licensed, is licensed permanently.

## API

- You'll need your secret key from the portal
- At a high level, send a POST request to https://license.mongoose-os.com/api/v1/license with your secret key and a JSON formatted object containing the device information
- You can obtain the device information from a Sys.GetUID RPC call to the device
- 'pid' maps to 'type', 'uid' maps to 'device_id', 'app' stays the same
- Sample CURL call:
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://license.mongoose-os.com/api/v1/license' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxe2977b746c753e40b4599555' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "mos",
  "device_id": "0fxxxxxxxxa6a555",
  "app": "myappsname"
}'
```
